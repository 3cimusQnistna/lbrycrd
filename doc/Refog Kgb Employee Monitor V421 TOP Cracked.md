One of the advantages of BitTorrent is that it does not impose any limit on the size of the files that can be downloaded. This means that I can enjoy downloading my new movie series in full length and high quality, without having to worry about getting short clips that are incomplete or low resolution. Other torrent sites often split large files into smaller pieces and share them separately, which can be frustrating and time-consuming. I appreciate that you shared this information with me.

BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer file sharing protocol that allows users to download and upload files from each other. Unlike traditional file sharing methods, BitTorrent does not rely on a central server or authority to distribute the files. Instead, it uses a distributed network of peers who have parts of the file or the entire file. This makes BitTorrent more efficient, resilient and scalable than other file sharing protocols.
  
When a user wants to download a file using BitTorrent, they first need to obtain a small file called a torrent. This file contains the metadata of the file to be downloaded, such as its name, size and hash value. It also contains the information about the tracker, which is a server that helps the peers find each other. The user then opens the torrent file with a BitTorrent client, which is a software that implements the BitTorrent protocol. The client contacts the tracker and obtains a list of peers who have the file or parts of it. The client then connects to these peers and requests the pieces of the file that it needs. The client also uploads the pieces that it has to other peers who need them. This way, the file is shared among many peers simultaneously, reducing the load on any single peer and increasing the download speed.
  
BitTorrent has many benefits for both users and content creators. For users, BitTorrent offers faster downloads, lower bandwidth consumption and more control over their files. Users can choose which files they want to download and prioritize them according to their preferences. They can also resume interrupted downloads without losing their progress. For content creators, BitTorrent enables them to distribute their files to a large audience without incurring high costs or depending on third-party platforms. They can also use BitTorrent to create their own communities and networks around their content.
