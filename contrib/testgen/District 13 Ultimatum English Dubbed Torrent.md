 Here is what I created:  
District 13 Ultimatum is not only an action-packed film, but also a social commentary on the issues of urban poverty, corruption, and discrimination. The film depicts a futuristic Paris where the government has isolated the most dangerous and impoverished neighborhoods in a walled-off district called District 13. The residents of District 13 are mostly immigrants, minorities, and rebels who have to deal with crime, violence, and oppression from both the gangs and the police.
 
The film follows the adventures of Leito and Damien, two unlikely allies who have to work together to stop a conspiracy that threatens to destroy District 13. Leito is a former gang member who lives in District 13 and fights for its freedom. Damien is an elite cop who specializes in martial arts and undercover missions. They have to infiltrate the district and find a video that exposes the corruption of a high-ranking official who wants to demolish District 13 and build a new luxury complex.
 
The film is a thrilling ride that showcases the amazing skills of the actors and stuntmen. David Belle is the co-founder of parkour, a discipline that involves moving through urban environments with speed, agility, and creativity. Cyril Raffaelli is a martial artist and stunt coordinator who has worked on films such as The Transporter and The Incredible Hulk. Together, they perform some of the most impressive and realistic action scenes ever seen on screen.
