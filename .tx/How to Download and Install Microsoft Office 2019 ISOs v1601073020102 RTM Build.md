In this article, we will show you how to download and install Microsoft Office 2019 ISOs v.16.0.10730.20102 (RTM Build), which is the official release version of Office 2019. We will also explain some of the new features and benefits of Office 2019, and how to activate it after installation.
  
## What's New in Office 2019?
  
Office 2019 is designed for users who prefer to use on-premises software rather than cloud-based services like Microsoft 365. Office 2019 offers some new features and improvements over Office 2016, such as:
  
- New inking tools, data types, functions, translation and editing tools, motion graphics, and ease-of-use features in the Office desktop apps[^2^]
- Improved security, stability, and performance updates[^1^]
- Support for Windows 10 and macOS devices[^3^]
- Five years of mainstream support and two years of extended support[^3^]

However, Office 2019 does not receive feature updates like Microsoft 365 does. It also has some limitations compared to Microsoft 365, such as:

- No access to cloud services like OneDrive, Teams, SharePoint, etc.
- No integration with Microsoft Power Platform (Power BI, Power Apps, Power Automate)
- No access to premium apps like Visio Online and Project Online
- No access to advanced security and compliance features like Advanced Threat Protection and Information Protection

If you want to enjoy these benefits, you may want to consider subscribing to Microsoft 365 instead of buying Office 2019.
  
## How to Download Office 2019 ISOs?
  
To download Office 2019 ISOs, you need to have a valid product key that you purchased from a retail store or online vendor. You can't use a product key for an older version of Office or a different edition of Office 2019.
  
Once you have your product key, follow these steps:

1. Go to [https://setup.office.com/](https://setup.office.com/) and sign in with your Microsoft account.
2. Enter your product key and select your country or region.
3. Select your preferred language and click Next.
4. You will see a page with a link to download your Office installation file. Click Download.
5. You will be redirected to another page where you can choose between a 32-bit or a 64-bit version of Office. We recommend choosing the 64-bit version unless you have compatibility issues with older add-ins or macros.
6. Click Download again and save the ISO file to your computer.

## How to Install Office 2019 ISOs?
  
To install Office 2019 ISOs, you need to mount the ISO file as a virtual drive on your computer. You can use a built-in tool in Windows 10 or macOS, or a third-party software like WinRAR or Daemon Tools.
  
Once you have mounted the ISO file, follow these steps:

1. Open the virtual drive and double-click Setup.exe (for Windows) or Install.pkg (for Mac).
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process.
3. When prompted, enter your product key again and activate your copy of Office.
