1. Verify the game files. Right-click on Tomb Raider in your Steam library, select Properties, then Local Files, then Verify Integrity of Game Files. This will check for any missing or corrupted files and download them if needed.
2. Re-install DirectX from the redist sub-directory in the Tomb Raider folder. You can find this folder by right-clicking on Tomb Raider in your Steam library, selecting Properties, then Local Files, then Browse Local Files. Open the redist folder and run DXSETUP.exe as administrator.
3. Try running the game at low or normal settings before high, ultra or ultimate. You can change the graphics settings by launching the game and selecting Options, then Graphics.
4. Turn on (or off) exclusive fullscreen. This option can also be found in the Graphics menu of the game. Some users have reported that enabling or disabling this option can fix the error.
5. Turn on (or off) vsync. This option can also be found in the Graphics menu of the game. Vsync synchronizes the frame rate of the game with your monitor's refresh rate, which can improve performance and prevent screen tearing. However, it can also cause some issues with some games, so you may want to try toggling it on or off.
6. Make sure you're NOT running any programs like FRAPS, MSI Afterburner, RivaTuner or any other overlay or recording software that may interfere with the game.
7. Make sure you've installed all updates & patches for your OS. You can check for Windows updates by opening the Start menu and typing "update".
8. Make sure you're running the latest drivers for your graphics card. You can download them from the official websites of NVIDIA or AMD, depending on your GPU model.
9. If you have an AMD GPU, try using AMD Gaming Evolved to configure the game. This is a software that optimizes your game settings based on your hardware and preferences. You can download it from [here](https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/gaming-evolved).
10. If you have an NVIDIA GPU, try using GeForce Experience to configure the game. This is a similar software that does the same thing as AMD Gaming Evolved. You can download it from [here](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/geforce-experience/).
11. Try running the game at a lower resolution. You can change the resolution by launching the game and selecting Options, then Display.
12. If nothing else works, try configuring the game to use DirectX 9 instead of DirectX 11. This is sometimes helpful for people with older graphics or Intel HD graphics. To do this, you need to edit a registry value as follows:
    - Launch the Registry Editor (open the Start menu and type "regedit" and press Enter)
    - Navigate to HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Crystal Dynamics\Tomb Raider\Graphics
    - Double click on the name RenderAPI
    - Change the RenderAPI value from 0 to 9
    - Click OK and then close the editor

We hope that one of these solutions works for you and you can enjoy playing Tomb Raider 2013 without any errors. If you have any questions or feedback, please leave a comment below.
